The authentication system provides:
- Complete React Context for global auth state management
- Session persistence and resumption
- Login/logout functionality with proper state management
- Loading states and comprehensive error handling
- Multi-service AT Protocol support (Bluesky, custom PDS, auto-detection)
- Integration with AT Protocol client

**Key Components**:
```typescript
interface AuthContextType {
  session: AuthSession | null
  loading: boolean
  isAuthenticated: boolean
  service: string | null
  login: (credentials: AuthCredentials) => Promise<void>
  logout: () => Promise<void>
}
```

### Dashboard System
**Status**: ✅ FULLY FUNCTIONAL  
**Location**: `src/components/full-dashboard.tsx`, `src/components/dashboard-with-hybrid-auth.tsx`

Complete dashboard implementation with:
- Responsive 3-column grid layout (FIXED)
- Real-time system metrics monitoring
- AT Protocol timeline integration
- Terminal widget with fullscreen mode
- Dynamic alerts system
- Proper authentication state management

### API Routes

│   └── route.ts          # System monitoring (CPU, memory, uptime)
└── atproto/
    └── timeline/
        └── route.ts      # AT Protocol timeline (GET/POST)
```

### Login Interface
**Status**: ✅ FULLY IMPLEMENTED  
**Location**: `src/components/login-modal.tsx`

Features:
- Modern modal-based UI with backdrop blur
- Handle/email and password input with validation
